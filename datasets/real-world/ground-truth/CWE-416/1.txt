The implementation of the following functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug:

FetchEvent.client.tlsCipherOpensslName
FetchEvent.client.tlsProtocol
FetchEvent.client.tlsClientCertificate
FetchEvent.client.tlsJA3MD5
FetchEvent.client.tlsClientHello
CacheEntry.prototype.userMetadata of the fastly:cache subsystem
Device.lookup of the fastly:device subsystem

This bug could allow for an unintended data leak 
if the result of the preceding functions were sent anywhere else, 
and often results in a Compute service crash causing an HTTP 500 error to be returned. 
As all requests to Compute are isolated from one another, the only data at risk is data present for a single request.
