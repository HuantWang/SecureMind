concat built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that 
was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause 
is that the build_IR for concat doesn't properly adhere to the API of 
copy functions (for >=0.3.2 the copy_bytes function).

A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were 
found in production.
