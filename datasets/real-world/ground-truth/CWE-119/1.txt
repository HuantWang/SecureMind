If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array 
in _abi_decode, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in 
the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially 
leading to bugs in contracts that use arrays within _abi_decode. 
The advisory has been assigned low severity, because it is only observable 
if there is a memory write between two invocations of abi_decode on the 
same input.
