If pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates is called with both:

1.A certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key
2.An encryption_algorithm with hmac_hash set (via PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)

Then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process.

This has been resolved, and now a ValueError is properly raised.
