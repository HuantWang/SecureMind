Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.3 are vulnerable 
to Improper Input Validation due to improper URL validation through the 
setUrl method. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability 
by utilizing view-source:file://, which allows for arbitrary file reading on a 
local file.
