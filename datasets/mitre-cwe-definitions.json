    "cwe-190": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound: The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control. An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number. While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on wrapping, it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs. This becomes security-critical when the result is used to control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc.",
    "cwe-416": "Use After Free: Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code. The use of previously-freed memory can have any number of adverse consequences, ranging from the corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the instantiation and timing of the flaw. The simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. Use-after-free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:\n1. Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n2. Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.\nIn this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.\nIf the newly allocated data happens to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.",
    "cwe-476": "NULL Pointer Dereference: A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit. A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit. NULL pointer dereference issues can occur through a number of flaws, including race conditions, and simple programming omissions.",
    "cwe-787": "Out-of-bounds Write: The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results. Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution.",
    "cwe-119": "Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: The product performs operations on a memory buffer without proper restrictions, allowing the operations to exceed intended boundaries. This can result in buffer overflows, crashes, or security vulnerabilities if attackers are able to execute code or manipulate memory arbitrarily. Common causes include improperly calculated buffer sizes, unsafe pointer arithmetic, or the absence of bounds checking before memory operations. This issue can be particularly dangerous when dealing with user-supplied data, as it opens avenues for exploitation and arbitrary code execution.",
    "cwe-125": "Out-of-bounds Read: The product reads memory outside the boundaries of an intended buffer. This can result in sensitive data exposure, crashes, or undefined behavior if critical information is accessed unintentionally. Out-of-bounds reads often occur due to insufficient bounds checking or improper index handling, particularly with user-supplied data inputs. Attackers may exploit this issue to retrieve sensitive information stored in adjacent memory or crash the application by accessing unreachable memory regions.",
    "cwe-415": "Double Free: The product invokes the memory deallocation function (e.g., free or delete) on the same memory address more than once, resulting in undefined behavior. This can corrupt memory, cause program crashes, or allow attackers to manipulate the heap for malicious purposes. Double-free issues typically occur due to programming errors such as freeing memory in multiple locations or confusion regarding ownership of a dynamically allocated resource. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to gain control over the programâ€™s execution.",
    "cwe-824": "Access of Memory Location After End of Its Lifetime: The program attempts to access a memory location that is no longer valid because it has been freed, deallocated, or gone out of scope. Accessing such memory results in undefined behavior, including crashes or corruption of valid data. This issue often arises due to misuse of pointers or a failure to manage the memory lifecycle effectively. When exploited, an attacker could corrupt data, crash the application, or execute arbitrary code if they are able to influence the state of deallocated memory.",
    "cwe-825": "Expired Pointer Dereference: The product dereferences a pointer after the memory it references has expired (i.e., the memory has been freed or gone out of scope). This results in undefined behavior, leading to crashes, invalid data access, or potential vulnerabilities similar to use-after-free conditions. This issue often stems from improper memory management or assuming the pointer remains valid after its target memory is freed. Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the expired pointer or execute arbitrary code by controlling memory allocations and data."
