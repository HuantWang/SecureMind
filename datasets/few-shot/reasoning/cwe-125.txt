The code is an example of **CWE-125: Out-of-Bounds Read**. The user is prompted to input an index to access an element in the fixed-size array (`array[5]`). If the index provided by the user is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the size of the array (5), it would result in an **out-of-bounds access**. Proper bounds checking is performed in the code to detect this and print a message when the index is invalid, mitigating the issue. However, the vulnerability could reappear if bounds checks are omitted or insufficient, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential leakage of sensitive memory data.
