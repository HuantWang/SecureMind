The code is vulnerable to **CWE-763: Release of Invalid Pointer or Resource** because the pointer `ptr` is deleted twice. After the first `delete`, the pointer becomes invalid (dangling), yet the code attempts to release the same memory again. This leads to **undefined behavior**, which can cause program crashes, data corruption, or be exploited by attackers to alter memory and gain control of the application. The absence of appropriate checks for pointer validity aggravates this issue.
