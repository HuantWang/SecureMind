The code demonstrates a vulnerability classified as **CWE-415: Double Free**. After allocating memory with `malloc` and freeing it using `free`, the code calls `free` on the same pointer again. This results in undefined behavior, such as crashes, memory corruption, or even exploitation by attackers to manipulate memory. Properly resetting the pointer to `NULL` after freeing the memory is a common mitigation to avoid double free issues.
