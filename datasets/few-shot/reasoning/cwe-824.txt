The code is an example of **CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer or Memory**. The function returns the address of a local variable (`num`) that goes out of scope once the function exits. Accessing the returned pointer in the `main` function leads to undefined behavior as it points to memory that is no longer valid. This can result in crashes, incorrect program behavior, or security vulnerabilities. Proper use of dynamically allocated memory or avoiding returning addresses of local variables can prevent this issue.
