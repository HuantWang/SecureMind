The function uses `strncpy` to limit the amount of data copied into the `buffer`, ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, the new implementation ensures that the `buffer` remains null-terminated. Instead of the unsafe `gets` function, `fgets` is used in combination with proper size management. It limits user input size to the length of the input buffer minus 1 character, ensuring no overflow.
