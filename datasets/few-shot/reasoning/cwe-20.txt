The code is vulnerable to improper input validation because it does not properly validate user input before converting it to an integer. The atoi function does not handle non-numeric input gracefully, potentially leading to unintended behavior such as interpreting invalid inputs as 0. Furthermore, negative values are only checked in process_age, but this does not prevent invalid input types from being processed.
