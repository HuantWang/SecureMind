The code is vulnerable to improper authentication because it does not securely validate user credentials. It uses strncmp() for password comparison, allowing partial matches to pass authentication. Additionally, the password is stored in plaintext, making it susceptible to exposure and attacks. An attacker could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access.
