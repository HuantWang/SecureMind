This code fixes the issue by setting the pointer to `nullptr` immediately after calling `delete`. In C++, deleting a `nullptr` is safe and has no effect, thereby preventing double deletion. Additionally, a check (`if (ptr)`) ensures that attempts to delete already-released (or uninitialized) memory wonâ€™t cause undefined behavior. These changes prevent the release of invalid pointers, enhancing the program's safety and adhering to proper resource management practices.
