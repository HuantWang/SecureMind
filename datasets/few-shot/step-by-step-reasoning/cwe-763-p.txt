Overview:
The code addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that dynamically allocated memory is properly managed. After deallocating the memory, the pointer is set to `nullptr` to prevent invalid operations.

Sub-components:
S1: The code sets the pointer to `nullptr` immediately after the memory is released.
S2: Before calling `delete`, the pointer is checked to ensure it is not already `nullptr`, preventing double deletion.

Analysis:
A-S1: Assigning `nullptr` to the pointer after deletion ensures that subsequent deletion attempts will safely do nothing (as deleting a `nullptr` is harmless).
A-S2: Checking the pointerâ€™s validity before deletion prevents access to a potentially dangling pointer, thereby avoiding undefined behavior.

Decision:
Based on A-S1 and A-S2, setting the pointer to `nullptr` after deletion and validating its state before subsequent operations effectively resolves the vulnerability associated with the release of invalid pointers.
