Overview:
The fixed code reads a string from the user and processes the string safely inside a fixed-size buffer, without causing memory corruption or overflow.

Sub-components:
S1: Input Function Handling -> checks if unsafe input reading is replaced with safer alternatives like fgets.
S2: Copy Operation -> ensures the copied data never exceeds the buffer's size and guarantees null-termination.
S3: Buffer Handling -> ensures proper buffer limits and avoids writing outside memory bounds.

Analysis:
A-S1: The input is read using `fgets`, which limits the input size to fit inside the `input` variable, preventing overruns. It also sanitizes input by removing the trailing newline if present.
A-S2: The function uses `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`, explicitly limiting the number of characters copied into the `buffer`. The copied string is null-terminated, preventing overflow.
A-S3: The size of the buffer is carefully observed, and all operations are bounded by the buffer length (`sizeof(buffer) - 1`). No writes occur beyond the allocated memory.

Decision:
Based on A-S1, the fixed code safely limits user input to prevent buffer overflows.
Based on A-S2, the fixed code prevents overflow during copy operations by limiting copied data and null-terminating strings.
Based on A-S3, bounds checking ensures no memory outside the buffer is written to or accessed.
