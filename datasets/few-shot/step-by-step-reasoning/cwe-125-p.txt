Overview:
The fixed program reads an integer index from the user and accesses an array. It ensures the index is within range before accessing the array, avoiding out-of-bounds memory access.

Sub-components:
S1: Input Handling -> checks if the user input is a valid integer.
S2: Array Access Logic -> ensures indices remain between valid array bounds (0 to 4).
S3: Error Messaging -> provides informative feedback when an invalid index is entered.

Analysis:
A-S1: The code validates the input using `scanf` to ensure it is a valid integer. If the input is invalid (non-integer), it displays an error and terminates early. This avoids unintended behavior due to malformed input.
A-S2: Before accessing the array, the index is validated to ensure it is between `0` and `4`. If the index is out of range, the function prints an error and terminates without accessing invalid memory addresses.
A-S3: Clear and actionable messages are displayed to the user when incorrect input or out-of-range indices are provided, helping prevent misuse of the program.

Decision:
Based on A-S1, the code is protected from invalid user inputs.
Based on A-S2, the code is safeguarded against out-of-bounds memory access (CWE-125).
Based on A-S3, the program is robust and user-friendly, preventing confusion or errors.
