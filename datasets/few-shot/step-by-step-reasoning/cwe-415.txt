Overview:
The code dynamically allocates memory using `malloc` and attempts to free it twice. This results in a double free vulnerability, which can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or memory corruption.

Sub-components:
S1: The allocation of memory using `malloc`.
S2: The first call to `free()` releases memory correctly.
S3: The second call to `free()` on the same memory pointer (`ptr`).

Analysis:
A-S1: The memory allocation uses `malloc`, and the program correctly checks whether `malloc` succeeded.
A-S2: The first call to `free()` correctly releases the allocated memory.
A-S3: The second call to `free()` attempts to free the same memory again, resulting in undefined behavior:
    - A runtime error may occur if the memory has already been returned to the system.
    - This might lead to memory corruption or exploitation by an attacker.

Decision:
The code is vulnerable to double free issues due to a lack of proper pointer management (e.g., setting `ptr = NULL` after freeing memory). This makes the program unsafe against memory management vulnerabilities.
