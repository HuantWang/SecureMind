Overview
The patched code ensures that user input is properly validated before processing.

Sub-components
S1 (Input Validation): The is_valid_number function checks if the input contains only numeric characters.
S2 (Bounds Checking): The process_age function enforces a valid age range (0â€“120).
Analysis
A-S1: The is_valid_number function ensures that input is not empty and does not contain non-numeric characters.
A-S2: The process_age function now includes an upper bound check to prevent unrealistic age values.
Decision
Based on A-S1 and A-S2, the patch mitigates CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) by ensuring input is both numeric and within a realistic range.
