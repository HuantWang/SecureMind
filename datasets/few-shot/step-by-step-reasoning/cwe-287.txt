Overview:
The code performs authentication by comparing user input with a stored password but fails to implement secure authentication mechanisms, allowing potential bypasses.

Sub-components:
S1: The strncmp function is used for password validation but only checks a limited number of characters.
S2: The password is stored in plaintext within the program, making it vulnerable to exposure and attacks.
Analysis:
A-S1: An attacker can input a longer string where the first few characters match the correct password, bypassing authentication due to strncmp() only checking the first strlen(PASSWORD) characters.
A-S2: Storing the password as plaintext makes it easier for an attacker to retrieve it through memory inspection or reverse engineering.
Decision:
Based on A-S1 and A-S2, the code is vulnerable to Improper Authentication (CWE-287) because it allows authentication bypass through partial password matching and insecure credential storage.
