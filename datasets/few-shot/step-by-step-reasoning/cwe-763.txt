Overview:
The code improperly releases dynamically allocated memory by deleting a pointer twice. This can lead to undefined behavior, including program crashes, memory corruption, or exploitation by attackers.

Sub-components:
S1: The pointer is manually allocated using `new` but is deleted twice in the same function.
S2: No check is performed to ensure that the pointer is valid before attempting to delete it a second time.

Analysis:
A-S1: Deleting the same pointer multiple times is a violation of proper memory management. After the first `delete`, the pointer becomes invalid (dangling) and referencing or deleting it again may corrupt the heap or cause memory issues.
A-S2: The absence of pointer validation (assigning `nullptr` after `delete`) means the program is unable to recognize that the pointer is invalid. This leads to unsafe memory operations and increases the risk of undefined behavior when the pointer is reused.

Decision:
Based on A-S1 and A-S2, the code is vulnerable to **CWE-763: Release of Invalid Pointer or Resource** due to improper memory deallocation and the lack of pointer sanity checks.
