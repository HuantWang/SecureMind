Overview
The patched code ensures that user authentication is secure by using hashed password verification instead of plaintext storage and weak comparisons.

Sub-components
S1 (Secure Hashing): The compute_sha256 function hashes the user input before authentication.
S2 (Proper Comparison): The authenticate function compares full-length hashes instead of plaintext passwords.
Analysis
A-S1: The compute_sha256 function prevents storing or handling plaintext passwords, reducing exposure to credential theft.
A-S2: The authenticate function uses strcmp() to securely compare full-length hashes, preventing partial password matching attacks.
Decision
Based on A-S1 and A-S2, the patch mitigates CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) by ensuring passwords are securely stored and verified using cryptographic hashing.
